See the wiring diagram for detailed overview, full assembly and wiring instructions exist on thingiverse & printables. The Lamp includes an ESP32-C3-Supermini but any ESP32, ESP8266 device can be used for this project as long as it can run ESPHome or WLED.

## ESPHOME

The code functions as such...

* A single press will toggle the LED light, it will resume whatever the last brightness setting was
* A double, triple, quad or hold press sends a unique event each to Home Assistant, this can then be used in Automations to control anything else.
* Turning the dial will increase or decrease the brightness only if the light is turned on.
  * If you try to increase the brightness past 100%, the light will flash to tell you it's at max brightness. and vice versa with the minimum brightness
 
## WLED

If youâ€™re considering using WLED, Follow the instructions here for the rotary encoder - https://mm.kno.wled.ge/usermods/Rotary-Encoder. I lean towards ESPHome, but I initially tested WLED. Unfortunately, I encountered issues with the rotary encoder functionality but you may be able to get this to work as it is supported.
